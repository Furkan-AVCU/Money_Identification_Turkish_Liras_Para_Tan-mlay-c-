With the help of artificial intelligence components such as image processing, deep learning, and mobile programming, the importance and use of which are increasing day by day, it is aimed to make a money identification mobile application to make the lives of people with visual disabilities easier. 

Flutter and TenserFlow-Lite technologies were used in this project. The application recognizes Turkish liras and announces it audibly and determines how much money is counted in total.
This app can work without internet connection.

 With this project, I applied to Tubitak's call with the code 2209.
